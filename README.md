# Silent Failure in Shell Script When Processing Non-Existent Files

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in a shell script that silently fails when attempting to process files that do not exist. The script uses a loop to iterate over a list of files and uses the `cat` command to concatenate their contents into an output file.  The issue is that if a file in the list does not exist, the `cat` command doesn't produce an error message, and the script continues execution without indicating the problem. This can lead to unexpected results, especially in scripts with more complex logic that depends on the existence of the files.

The `bug.sh` file contains the buggy script, while `bugSolution.sh` demonstrates a corrected version that handles missing files gracefully.
